# powershell-scripts

Assorted powershell scripts ranging from AD/Windows Server administration to stripping subtitle tracks from video w/ mkvmerge, and everything in between.

Nothing in here is 100% guaranteed to work, or to fit every edge case. They're created primarily for my own individual use-case, but are written generic enough that parts can be taken out, interchanged, or otherwise modified to suit your needs/work in your environment. Check the description block on each file to make sure you're not missing any dependencies, which are usually *(on a good-faith basis)* called out. 

This repo is licensed under the un-license, so have at the code and modify it for your needs. If you see something obvious that needs correcting, or can make a contribution to augment any particular script in a generic manner, make a pull request.
